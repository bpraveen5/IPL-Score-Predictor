# IPL-Score-Predictor

- This is just another simple yet intresting project which can approximately predict an innings score based on the data from 2008-2017 IPL season.  
- I tried training three models:  
 1. Linear Regression  
 2. Lasso  
 3. Ridge   
- Deployed using Flask.  
- Just run app.py and go to localhost to see the results.
